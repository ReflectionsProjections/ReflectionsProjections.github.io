# Reflections | Projections 2018

## Setup
Clone this repository and run `yarn` to install all dependencies. You need to do this before attempting anything else.

## Development
Run `yarn dev` for a live-reloading development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Adding Dependencies
Run `yarn add <Dependency>` to add more dependencies. Add the `--dev` flag to the previous command if the plugin is only required during development (for example, formatters, linters etc.) but not during production.
