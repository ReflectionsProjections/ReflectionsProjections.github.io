The competition will begin with the opening ceremony and announcement of the game on Friday, September 21st after which the programming component will commence immediately. The competition will conclude with the closing ceremony and awards presentation on Saturday, September 22nd after running for 24 hours.",<br/>, <br/> ,"Register for MechMania", <a href="https://acmrp.typeform.com/to/MR6XmN" target="_blank"> here</a>,"!

Teams do not need to be comprised of all students from the same school, but all participants must be actively enrolled in a college or university.")

                "answer": "All members should be proficient in the programming language their team intends to use. The API will use JSON messages passed over HTTP, so we recommend having knowledge of a JSON library in your chosen language."

                "answer": "No prior knowledge of any specific languages are required. You won't need a background in artificial intelligenceâ€”in previous years, many teams without an AI background have competed and done well, or even won. You also shouldn't need knowledge of network programming beyond HTTP requests."

You may, however, bring non-code items like rc files, build scripts, notes, etc. Competitors are required to bring their own laptops, though the code you write must be capable of running on our systems."

Our API will provide you information about the current state of the game, as well as allow you to send commands to play it.
