Puzzles are released online at ", <a href='https://puzzlebang.com' target='_blank'>puzzlebang.com</a>, "roughly one per day until Saturday, when we release several hard puzzles and a physical, on-campus metapuzzle that pulls everything together.  In the last two years, PuzzleBang also included a real life escape room (themed to, but otherwise unrelated to the puzzlebang.com puzzles)."]

Number of letters in the alphabet, number of cards in a deck, all the US state abbreviations, and silly other things that you've probably run across in your daily life. Some awareness of the recent memes and popular culture will probably be helpful. Knowledge of current events at UIUC and the campus layout will be really helpful."

It might be useful to be able to write a script to print out all the ways you can rearrange a set of letters, or apply different ciphers to them, but in general, you should be able to do everything by hand, or ask Google and find a tool online to do it for you"
